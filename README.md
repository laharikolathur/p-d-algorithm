# p-d-algorithm
A new CPU scheduling algorithm based on priority and deadline
P&D algorithm is Priority & Deadline algorithm. This algorithm will
basically take into account the priority of the process and deadline of
the previous processes. If the deadline of any of the earlier process is
very near then, deadline will be given more importance than the

priority of the present algorithm. Both the priority and deadline will be
user defined.
